<i><q>I think that almost every user of those HTC devices which are equipped with proximity sensor suffer from this symptom: When device is in pocket facing the body near the skin, after hanging up a call or firing an event the screen stays unlocked for the screen lock timeout. This leads to unwanted events and awkward situations because the phone gets operated by the near skin.<br>
I think, it would be obvious that when in proximity, the whole touch screen should be disabled in general, the same way as it acts while being in a call. It could be extended to the whole system.<br>
If there's a reason it shouldn't be done, it might then be the problem of the Android system. When phone was locked before having a call or getting an alert/notification, it should continuously stay that way after the events.</q></i>
